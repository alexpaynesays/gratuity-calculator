<h2><a href="https://alex-payne1.gitlab.io/gratuity/">How to Use a Gratuity Calculator in the UAE?</a></h2>

<h2>What is an End of Service Calculator?</h2>

<p>An end of service calculator is a financial tool designed to help employees estimate their gratuity or end-of-service benefits when leaving a job. This calculator simplifies the process by allowing users to input their basic salary, years of service, and contract type to receive an instant estimate of their gratuity entitlement.</p>

 <h2>Importance of Using an End of Service Calculator</h2>
<h3>Accuracy</h3>
    <p>Provides a precise estimate of your gratuity based on the latest UAE labor laws.</p>

  <h3>Time-Saving: </h3>
<p>  Eliminates the need for complex manual calculations.</p>
<h3>Financial Planning: </h3>
<p>  Helps employees understand their financial entitlements and plan for their future.</p>

<h2>Factors Influencing Gratuity Calculation</h2>

<p>Several key factors influence the amount of gratuity an employee can expect to receive:

<h3> 1. Basic Salary</h3>

<p>The basic salary is the primary component in gratuity calculations. Only the basic salary is considered, excluding allowances, bonuses, or other benefits. </p>

<h3> 2. Duration of Service</h3>

<p>The length of service is critical for gratuity calculation. Employees must complete at least one year of continuous service to be eligible for gratuity. The gratuity amount varies based on the number of years worked:</p>

<p>1 to 5 years: 21 days of salary for each year of service.</p>
<p> 5 years and above: 30 days of salary for each additional year.</p>

<h3>3. Type of Employment Contract</h3>

<p>The type of contract—limited or unlimited—affects gratuity calculations:</p>

<p><b>Limited Contracts:</b> 
  <p>These specify a fixed term of employment. If an employee resigns before the contract ends, they may still be entitled to gratuity based on the duration of service.</p>
  
<b> Unlimited Contracts:</b> 
  <p>Employees on unlimited contracts have more flexibility regarding termination. The gratuity calculation remains the same, but the conditions for termination may vary.</p>

<h2>How to Use an End of Service Calculator</h2>
